A Memphis community demands reparations for unknowingly hosting the toxic waste of war
::

It was October of 1995, just as the cool evenings set in, in Memphis, Tennessee, when things began looking up for Ms. Doris Bradshaw[\[a\]](#cmnt1). Suddenly, it all made sense.

Earlier that year, her 84-year-old grandmother, Suzie Hall, had found a few drops of blood in her underwear. After a visit to the doctor led them to a specialist, it turned out her grandmother — who spent her days vigorously, shucking corn and shelling peas from the yard, rising long before dawn on Sundays to prepare dinner for anyone who’d like to stop in — had developed kidney cancer. And it had spread to four other sites. By June, her body could no longer take the assault. Everyone was shocked, including her doctors. “Dr. Edwards told me he had never in his life seen a cancer that aggressive,” Ms. Doris, now 67, remembers. “You could see it growing.”

In the weeks prior to her grandmother’s death — days spent preparing for surgeries, radiation and rest — Ms. Doris had pushed aside an abnormal piece of mail: a thick booklet she’d received, with a white address sticker pasted in the corner, like a weekly magazine. “There may be some contamination in your community,” she recalls it spelling out. Ms. Doris called the number on the mailer, hoping to speak with someone at the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), who had sent out the information. But no one picked up. In the whirlwind of trying to help her grandma heal, the pamphlet, filled with the worrisome conditionals, “may be polluted,” “might be contaminated,” slipped away.

But soon after her grandmother passed, Ms. Doris dug up the booklet again, suspecting a connection. It turned out the government was suggesting potential toxicity at the [Memphis Defense Depot](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id%3D0404159&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714963273&usg=AOvVaw3rqhHYMc4YcO87wCw2ld56) — a sprawling site that the U.S. military had used since 1942, as a distribution center for munitions, medical supplies and petroleum products — blocks away from the Bradshaws. It was vague. And only some neighbors had received it. But it seemed like something everyone should be talking about.

![A map showing the location of Tennesee with Memphis in the southwestern corner highlighted](/assets/images/memphis_satellite_locator.r1.png)

So she drew up some flyers with a skull and crossbones pasted in the center, calling for a meeting at her children’s school, Norris Elementary. She enlisted the help of friends and family to hit the streets and make sure residents on all sides of the Defense Depot got one.

On the afternoon of the meeting, families packed the school cafeteria. Some had received the same booklet that Ms. Doris had, others had not. But just about everyone had a story about a family member, or a string of neighbors who’d dealt with an odd combination of lethal conditions: kidney disease, brain cancer, fibroids the size of a cantaloupe.

Besides the health conditions, there was one other thing everyone in the room had in common that day: they lived within walking distance of the Defense Depot. Though residents didn’t know it at the time, the facility also included a 60-acre parcel of land north of the Depot proper that some residents looked out onto from their front stoops, or walked by en route to school, where leaking mustard bombs had been buried decades ago. Known as Dunn Field, some residents wondered why the oak-lined hills and valleys where this was all occurring hadn’t just been turned into a park.

Though residents didn’t recall seeing any signs posted anywhere warning them of potentially toxic activity occurring a hop, skip and a jump from their front porches and gardens, the papers reported on it from time-to-time. In 1959, a local newspaper, the Commercial Appeal,[\[b\]](#cmnt2) described an incident: “The Army fell on troubled times yesterday, trying to bury 20 tons of chemicals,” the story read, describing the dumping of a chemical agent into a 125-foot ditch at the Depot. “Rain set it ‘afire.’ Bulldozers tried to cover it with dirt. It just added to a churning mess which sent up a big orange cloud. Then an ill wind sent an irritating odor over much of Southeast Memphis.”

In October 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) added the Defense Depot to its list of the most contaminated sites in the U.S., also known as the National Priorities List (NPL) — then [1,183 sites long](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epa.gov/superfund/number-npl-sites-each-status-end-each-fiscal-year&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714964686&usg=AOvVaw10H0CMOFNxoCfA-PpZFJkB). The NPL list, and the Superfund program, was launched in 1980, through the enactment of the [Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-comprehensive-environmental-response-compensation-and-liability-act%23:~:text%3DThe%2520Comprehensive%2520Environmental%2520Response%252C%2520Compensation%252C%2520and%2520Liability%2520Act%2520%252D%252D%2520otherwise,and%2520contaminants%2520into%2520the%2520environment&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714965149&usg=AOvVaw18THxerACF6k3M-2CTeTNL) (CERCLA), which introduced a tax on chemical and petroleum industries in order to build up monies with which to fund the cleanup of hazardous-waste sites and spills on the NPL list.

CERCLA has led to cleanup efforts of whopping proportion, and helped to fold numerous former wastelands back into communities. But as Dr. Reuben Warren[\[c\]](#cmnt3), director of the Tuskegee University National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care told me, for environmental justice communities, it also “leaves much to be desired.”  
  
More than four decades after the program launched, Superfund sites still [disproportionately impact](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/documents/superfund_remediation_and_redevelopment_for_environmental_justice_communities_may_2021_report.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714966005&usg=AOvVaw0ScCorwShrB8KctRRKVc-m) low-income and communities of color — like those living in Ms. Doris’ census tract, which is [93 percent Black](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ejscreen.epa.gov/mapper/demogreportpdf.aspx?report%3Dacs2019&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714966391&usg=AOvVaw2pawftMir_N1Ej_6fAy06q), and in the [98th percentile](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ejscreen.epa.gov/mapper/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714966765&usg=AOvVaw0h0tkm8Xsa0AMBeEfjGajP) in the U.S. in terms of proximity to a Superfund site. Now, with environmental justice top of mind for advocates who helped elect President Biden to office, there’s a push to shed light on and pick up the pace of cleanup[\[d\]](#cmnt4) — which appears to have been inordinately slow for some Black, Indigenous and migrant residents in comparison with the equivalent processes occurring at Supersites in whiter areas[\[e\]](#cmnt5) — and to track whether cleanup funding directly benefits impacted communities, or not.

While the EPA highlights its [success stories](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-success-stories&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714967551&usg=AOvVaw1_gCZe0d-kBx0cUYS4LLBR), there’s often a discrepancy between official reports, and the experiences and feelings of residents on the ground, who have suffered the often-devastating impacts of living near a Supersite. Part of this is because while CERCLA lays out a framework for how agencies will work together on processes like soil and water testing, and deciding what kind of treatment would return a site to being “usable,” the law hasn’t required polluters or governments to make right with the communities they’ve harmed, only to be held accountable for paying to restore the site. Nor does CERCLA require much in the way of public participation, which is why generations of Depot-area residents like Ms. Doris, have felt like they’ve been left in the dark.[\[f\]](#cmnt6)

Ms. Doris was not the first area resident to demand answers. In 1993, residents showed up at the middle school to express concern to Depot officials, after a federal report detailed how lead, trichloroethylene and other toxins had been found in the water table. “We want to know what happened 20 years ago,” Andre Dean[\[g\]](#cmnt7) said at the meeting. “I want to know should I be living here and do I want to raise my children here?” Reportedly, Navy Capt. Harvey Hennedy responded that there was no existing statistical information to support resident concerns over health problems.

But it was there in the Norris Elementary school cafeteria, with a stage as her backdrop, that Ms. Doris and her neighbors made a formal promise to get to the bottom of the illnesses that touched them all. They would call themselves Defense Depot Memphis Tennessee Concerned Citizens Committee (DDMT-CCC). It didn’t roll off the tongue, but did tell anyone who came across them what they were about.

A local newspaper reporter from the Commercial Appeal had shown up, though Ms. Doris maintains that the reporter, Lela Garlington, estimated the crowd at 90 people, when Ms. Doris herself had collected over 300 names.[\[h\]](#cmnt8) “That place was packed, people were standing up around the wall.”

With a formal name, and a mission top-of-mind, her group began getting more press. And with it, the phone began to ring. First it was Charlotte Keys, in Colombia, Mississippi, who had formed a similar group, Jesus People Against Pollution, after a 1977 explosion at Reichhold Chemical. And it snowballed from there. Before long, Ms. Doris was getting calls from students with the Southern Student Organizing Committee; and the head of a group dedicated to improving conditions for coal miners, Appalachian Focus, to swap stories of the ailments that had popped up in their necks of the woods. It was shocking. “We didn’t know anybody else was suffering like this.”

Five years after her grandmother passed away so suddenly, Ms. Doris had met dozens of others working on similar issues in every corner of the U.S. Though it was illness, and anger that brought her together with those suffering from pollution in the hearts of their communities too, Ms. Doris told me, propping herself up on a pillow where she lay on the leather couch, her eyes lighting up, that those years were some of the best of her life.

By 2000, with the help of new friends, Ms. Doris had a vision for how officials could begin to make things right in Memphis: schroud the rolling hills of Dunn Field, where sun streamed down onto grasses belted by a chain linked fence, where the mustard bombs lay, with solar panels. Power the neighborhood. “All the toxic lands, that’s the only thing they were good for.”

It was the least they could do.

## II.

The brick home with a high-perched porch where Ms. Doris’ son Victor let me in on a sunlit-sprinkled afternoon in May, sits proudly between two white-shingled houses that now slouch under the weight of the years, all built by Ms. Doris’ great grandfather. They’re perched atop a hill that rises up on one side of Mallory Avenue, looking over what used to be a strawberry field.  
  
The front yard is filled with places to sit, a grill and a bird feeder, holiday lights strung up framing other well-worn signs of time spent gathering. One house to the west, where Ms. Doris moved after she divorced her husband, is now packed to the brim with documents and videotapes, from her twenty years of being called on to serve on the National Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (NEJAC) and other environmental justice leadership posts. But she can’t get to them to show me, because she’s all-but-bed-ridden when I visit, resting under a fleece blanket, with a pink Happy Mothers Day balloon blowing in the breeze above her. She’s been on dialysis for four years, and is waiting on a kidney transplant. But Ms. Doris is determined to fix the roof, now caving in, so water doesn’t trickle in and damage all the artifacts she’s saved, the testimony she’s captured on tape, and the legacy of her family. “I was born on this hill,” she tells me. Her street, Mallory Avenue, predates many that have since been paved around it. It also predates the Defense Depot itself.[\[i\]](#cmnt9) 

Having left Mississippi during the Great Migration, Ms. Doris’ family landed here, where they grew peaches, collard greens and raised chickens, supported by Ms. Doris' grandfather, who served in the military and sent money back home to his family, which they used to build, and then upkeep their three family houses.

Before the Department of Defense chose the site to host its massive supply center, the area was prime, Mississippi Delta farmland. But suddenly in the scramble of preparing for war, in 1942, 50 days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Ms. Doris’ family’s part of town was given an official purpose. Just south of where “X” marks the spot on a map of Memphis, where Illinois Central Railroad intersects with the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad, the Defense Logistics Agency chose fertile ground from which to receive and send equipment all over the globe.

Patriotism and pride filled newspaper headlines as 1941 became 1942: “Even before the Japanese attack, the spirit of defense was evident in this Memphis Armistice Day parade of 1941,” a cartoon depicting Uncle Sam smoking a cigar on an armchair while inspecting a photograph taken in Memphis, was captioned. Over 3,500 new jobs were available, all supporting heroic war efforts, and top-ranking officers were sent to town to run the Depot, including its Chemical Warfare section. [\[j\]](#cmnt10)

Then, [in July 1946](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ww3.sam.usace.army.mil/DDMT/docs/AR428-1.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714970785&usg=AOvVaw3rY3ss32IGGOg8fxQEEZoI), three freight cars filled with 500-pound German mustard bombs arrived in Memphis, leaking, en route from New Orleans to Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The casings, which had burned some [100 workers](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ww3.sam.usace.army.mil/DDMT/docs/AR431-1.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714971145&usg=AOvVaw3eGdNn8nVTgO5ZRhO-wcOH) in Theodore, Alabama, before heading to Memphis, were removed from the trains. Once they were neutralized, they needed to be buried. And Dunn Field — that rolling, grassy patch, appeared the perfect location.

The houses on Hays Road, Dunn Field’s eastern boundary, hadn’t yet been built.[\[k\]](#cmnt11) But less than a mile away, using money Ms. Doris’ grandfather sent back from World War II, her family was busy building what would become their three family homes, just above the creeks and drainage ditches, the arteries of the area.

## III.  
  
First thing on a dry-hot morning in May, I drive over to Hamilton High School, a 1970’s concrete structure made of geometric shapes overlaid on one another like a partially-solved rubix cube, where I park under a hulking blackberry bush. The school, which serves teenagers from neighborhoods surrounding the Defense Depot, is built over a slow-trickling stream. Known as Cane Creek, the water runs near the house where Ms. Doris spent her married years, on Cincinnati Street, before it empties out into Nonconnah Creek, a larger ribbon that oxbows under highways and railroad tracks before joining the Mississippi River, to the west.

I wanted to visit the school because Ms. Doris told me that heavy metals had been found in Cane Creek there, which according to government documents, including a 1995 report published by the Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry (ATSDR)[\[l\]](#cmnt12), catches runoff from Dunn Field — where those leaky mustard bombs were buried, along with 30 pallets of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, 3,768 cans of methyl bromide and [at least 30 other toxic substances](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ww3.sam.usace.army.mil/DDMT/docs/AR99-1.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714972212&usg=AOvVaw0qeSEjBy2IC4MPw-by2IdT).

Sure enough, Cane Creek runs directly under the school cafeteria, like a Mid-South Venice-gone-wrong. I asked Ms. Doris’ neighbor Frank Johnson[\[m\]](#cmnt13), who met me there, to point out what Ms. Doris had referred to as a lovers lane, a concrete bridge that provided cover to young couples stealing away for a moment alone. Cane Creek, which is flanked on all sides by concrete, out of which jasmine and beech trees manage to emerge, is almost beautiful. The slow trickle of its water is matched by cars racing up Elvis Presley Boulevard, toward downtown.

In his 45 years, Frank has lived many lives. Equal parts jolly and in-arms, he’s a stout, charismatic opera singer and formally-trained journalist who now works as a neighborhood connector for the Center for Transforming Communities, a Memphis-based non-profit.

As we cross the concrete bridge over the creek that connects the high school parking lot to its sports field, the creek’s lushness makes it easy to picture what the land may have looked like before subdivisions, and the Defense Depot, spliced it up. But its beauty doesn’t mean everyone who resides here, as much as they may love it now, actually chose to live here.

The Depot ramped up its flow of war supplies again during the Korean war, and later during the Vietnam War. Neighborhoods filled in along the fields and furrows on all sides of the military facility. In 1959, amid the post-war housing crunch, Frank’s father, William Johnson, a 27-year-old veteran and U.S. postal worker, purchased a lot in what would be the first addition to Norris View Subdivision[\[n\]](#cmnt14), a neighborhood of three-bedroom brick homes with wrought-iron columns, knotty pine cabinets and tiled showers.[\[o\]](#cmnt15) Though now, the neighborhood ranks [96 and 97th percentile](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/%2313.62/35.08201/-90.00888&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714973423&usg=AOvVaw1hMVwfBJJrcNZTy_fLDFp0) for poverty and unemployment, consecutively, it wasn’t originally a low-income neighborhood.Like many families that have landed in the area surrounding the Depot[\[p\]](#cmnt16), Frank lives there because his family was displaced by waves of racist government policy — not once, but multiple times. Had it not, Frank and his family might have been living further from the one-mile radius “red zone” of the, closer to downtown, where his grandfather, Frank Johnson Sr., an escaped slave born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, had built the family a house, on Porter Street.

The original structure, where Frank Sr. resided with his wife Eva, and their seven children, on Porter street, is no longer there. But Frank Jr. drives by it regularly. It was the family’s place. It was a set of walls that they crafted and owned, on the outskirts of old South Memphis, where middle-class and affluent African Americans had built homes and businesses just south of the city center, including along the now-famous Beale Street. Frank Sr., who had a fourth-grade education, worked many jobs to keep up the home: auto repair, as a boiler helper, doing farm work.[\[q\]](#cmnt17) But in the 1940’s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), a New Deal-era government-sponsored corporation [redlined a vast swath of the city](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/%23loc%3D13/35.132/-90.059%26city%3Dmemphis-tn&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714974261&usg=AOvVaw3hbGyCytJhdYY7ACmPUl7r) backing up to the Mississippi River, including Porter Street, thereby designating it as hazardous, “characterized by detrimental influences in a pronounced degree, under desirable population,” which tended to mean non-whites or migrants, “or an infiltration of it.”  As a result of the practice, residents living there, like Frank Sr., couldn’t get loans, and investment was funneled elsewhere.

“Even the better class of negro houses are deteriorating badly because owners can not afford to make repairs,” executive director of Memphis Housing Authority, J.A. Fowler wrote to the mayor of Memphis, in December 1949, failing to acknowledge how the area had been targeted by HOLC for systematic disinvestment, in being redlined.

Then, on the heels of the 1949 American Housing Act, which availed $1.5 billion in federal loans and grants for “urban redevelopment,” city politicians considered four sites that would “make available considerable land and eradicate a good portion of the present slum areas.”

Fowler refers to the swells and stream channels where Frank Sr. had built up his life, known at the time as Suzette Bottoms, as “a definite and deplorable slum,” which, “ought to be among the areas cleared under the proposed Urban Redevelopment Law now being considered by Congress.”[\[r\]](#cmnt18)

So, having been redlined and disinvested in, Frank Sr.’s house was condemned for public purposes, as the family story goes. In 1950, Frank Sr. and his family returned home one day to find all their belongings on the front lawn. “They were always afraid of that: somebody just coming in and taking it,” Frank recounted.

The family moved up the road, into a public housing project known as Foote Homes. It wasn’t the same as having one’s own space. And the move took a toll. In September 1951, months after being displaced from Porter Street, Eva found Frank Johnson Sr. hunched over the kitchen table, his pulse having left his body. “I think that broke him,” Frank told me. “Died suddenly without attendance,” his death certificate reads. “No medical history could be obtained.”[\[s\]](#cmnt19)

Wanting to give their mother a home of her own again, to get her out of Foote Homes, William Johnson, Frank Sr.’s son, bought a lot in the Norris View Subdivision, where Frank Jr. would grow up, in a brick house with black shutters, blocks away from the Defense Depot.

Just years prior, in 1948, in [Shelley v. Kraemer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/shelley_v_kraemer_(1948)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714976125&usg=AOvVaw3P27DdvQH20iaDFd4EKB7H), the Supreme Court had struck down the use of racial covenants, which had previously prevented residents of color from purchasing homes or land in an area designated “white.” But in practice, subdivisions in much of the expanding city continued to be segregated, designed “for negros” or “for whites.”[\[t\]](#cmnt20) Numerous residents who I interviewed for this story made a similar migration as Frank’s family,[\[u\]](#cmnt21) from Foote Homes to the Depot neighborhoods, citing a lack of other options, only to later find out that both places had been built upon toxic ground.

“We were funneled into these communities,” Frank said.

## IV.

For as long as Frank can remember, Ms. Doris has been a presence in the Depot area. When he was a kid, Ms. Doris worked the mailroom at Boatmen’s Bancshares. She also walked the streets, at least a mile a day, talking to kids, and heeding her doctor’s orders to “stay active,” after being diagnosed with pre-diabetes. And she seemed to always be at Norris Elementary, leading the Parent-Teacher Association. “I mean, everybody knows Ms. Bradshaw. Everybody,” Frank said when I asked him to describe her.

(On the day the renowned and beloved rapper known as Young Dolph was killed a few blocks away, at Makeda’s Cookies, in November 2021, he had made sure to send Ms. Doris a turkey, double-checking with her son Rudolph that it had arrived, just minutes before his death.)

But after the 1995 meeting at Norris Elementary, at which DDMT-CCC was formed, suddenly, Ms. Doris was out of town a lot. “My mission was to go out and find what has happened to this community.” Much of that occurred at home, speaking with ministers at the 20 churches surrounding the Depot, sprinkled between 25 culverts through which Depot-draining creek water trickled. But it also took her far and wide, sometimes to Arkansas, to visit her friend Evelyn Yates, who was fighting the construction of the [Pine Bluff Chemical Agent Disposal Facility](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.army.mil/article/117703/pine_bluff_chemical_agent_disposal_facility_prepared_for_final_closure&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714977616&usg=AOvVaw2vT8OdeNzhHxIEYnPWoTFv). Other times, to Puerto Rico to meet with residents living around the U.S. Navy’s former [Naval Training Range](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/vieques-invisible-health-crisis/498428/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714977984&usg=AOvVaw18erQnteK6xlstUkBLc6T-) on the island of Vieques, where from 1941 to 2001, the Navy stored ammunition and conducted live-training bombing and gunfire exercises. “Everywhere there was a military site, people were leading that fight. They knew things was wrong,” Ms. Doris explained. Many were fast friends, like Chavez Lopez, who lived near the former [Kelly Air Force Base](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.afcec.af.mil/Home/BRAC/Kelly.aspx&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714978368&usg=AOvVaw0iemSRxOxTDG-ZQJnhVvDo) in San Antonio, Texas; and LeVonne Stone, who lived near the former [Fort Ord Army post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fortordcleanup.com/about/fort-ord-and-brac-history/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714978674&usg=AOvVaw0cCV8vi_hsLIA2UiYRwb19) in Marina, California.

As Ms. Doris continued to meet others with similar stories of obscure cancers that shocked their doctors and their worlds, of birth defects and learning disabilities — so similar, and yet hundreds of miles away from Memphis — Ms. Doris was struck by memories, and retrospective realizations of exposure.  
  
There had been the pipes in her house. The gooseneck bend below the kitchen sink, where the water dips down before it comes up, wouldn’t last more than a year before needing to be replaced. “That metal, it’d crumble in your hand. So whatever was in the water, we had all got it in us.”  
  
She also thought back to when her old Scottish terrier, Princess, was alive, who greeted her at the door in the morning, ready to go to the bathroom. Ms. Doris and Princess both used to get blisters on their legs where they brushed up against the dew on the grass. When she noticed, Ms. Doris put Princess on a leash, and they stuck to the sidewalk for Princess’ morning relief. And the sores healed.

Then there was the time that her son Rudolph's neck swelled up so much he could hardly breathe. The day before, Ms. Doris had found him playing in a pile of soil that officials had dug up and left in the process of laying a culvert through which Cane Creek water could run, along the back of Ms. Doris’ house where she had moved for a few years, on Cincinnati street. “He woke up screaming and hollering,” she told me, so she rushed him to the hospital. No one had alerted her to the fact that there could be toxic substances in the sediment, given that the water drained from Depot grounds. The doctors didn’t run any blood tests, or toxicity tests, or ask any questions about the potential for exposure. “Nobody did stuff like that back in those days,” she said.

  
Once the culvert was installed, they covered the pipe back up with the same soil that had given Rudolph a fierce reaction. “They didn’t do it right,” Ms Doris told me, eyebrows raised. “Or they didn’t know how to do it. Or they just didn’t care.”

During dozens of meetings, whether hosted by the Memphis Environmental Justice Working Group, or the Department of Defense’s Restoration Advisory Board (RAB), in spite of the similar experiences they shared, area residents were met with ongoing dismissal. Part of the problem was a pure lack of representation. At first, [not a single member](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ffwg-final-rpt-102504.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714979665&usg=AOvVaw3L8RfmedbbXmHfwgLVU2wR) from an immediate community was invited to serve on the RAB board. Its community co-chair was a white male activist who didn’t live in the Depot neighborhoods. When workers brought up concerns about what they had observed on Depot property, they were [allegedly reprimanded](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ffwg-final-rpt-102504.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714979982&usg=AOvVaw0l9Vp-yzdlluPyWuhREkuA) at work, or forced to quit.

\[At one meeting, in 2000, which community members organized in response to a frightening wave of cervical and uterine cancer diagnoses in teenagers and young women, Ms. Doris recalls a government official making a particularly disparaging defense, when accused of not being forthcoming with activities occuring at the Depot. “They said that we eat too much fat, processed meat,” Ms. Doris recalled. “And that the women are promiscuous.”\][\[v\]](#cmnt22)

Furious over dismissive officials who turned down requests for testing in Depot neighborhoods, and then issued reports that stated: “there is currently no information available on contamination in the ditches on western side of Dunn Field,” or “no information is available on the possible contamination of Nonconnah Creek or Cane Creek,”[\[w\]](#cmnt23) Ms. Doris called up scientists at the Howard University Environmental Justice Partnership.

So in 2000, a team of Howard scientists landed in Memphis. [\[x\]](#cmnt24)One was an atmospheric scientist, another a chemist, the third a civil engineer. The group took an [altogether different approach](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3807517/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714981304&usg=AOvVaw3YCykcBHakeBxFtZZnJ1tE), noting the shortcomings of previous health assessments not having collected samples in the places where residents were most concerned with having been exposed to toxins, in the places where they walked, played and breathed; and having used generic tests for substances like “pesticides, metals and VOCs,” rather than identifying tracers, like enhanced arsenic levels, or other elements that would signal that chemical warfare agents of concern had broken down over the years, and migrated off site.

The testing-to-publication process took six years, but by 2006, Depot-area residents finally had [data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3807517/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714981827&usg=AOvVaw1yg1EJEj9YRSq5yyCsieXP) that backed up some of their suspicions. The Howard University team had tested for heavy metals in four sites: at the end of Rozelle Street, a residential lane that dead-ends at Dunn Field; a storm water drain shuttling runoff out of the southeast corner of the Depot; a drainage ditch extending from the Depot’s western boundary; and from the stretch of Cane Creek that runs under Hamilton High School.

One finding was particularly unnerving. In three of the four sites they tested, including Hamilton High, levels of chromium, a lustrous metal that [has been linked with](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/chromium/physiologic_effects_of_chromium_exposure.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714982405&usg=AOvVaw2_YfvfWT-HP5rDJsCCdNKu) respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, developmental issues, and cancer, were detected at [126 parts per million](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3807517/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714982714&usg=AOvVaw1wt4PvUzVQAiAPeAnVALTN) — triple the EPA’s limit at the time.

It seemed like more than coincidence. In the short-term, according to [EPA documents](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.epa.gov/water/archive/web/pdf/archived-consumer-fact-sheet-on-chromium.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714983204&usg=AOvVaw3MUM1Sc3ajG0UFxnEMh8py), exposure to chromium can cause skin irritation and ulcers — like what Rudolph suffered from after playing in the dirt, and the Scottish terrier, Princess experienced when peeing in the yard at dawn. In the long-term, repeated exposure can cause nerve, liver and kidney issues, like what Ms. Doris is dealing with now.

Though it was only one piece of the puzzle, it was something. “This should provide clear justification for further sampling and detailed analysis of environmental contamination of the adjacent neighborhoods,” [the paper](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3807517/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714983668&usg=AOvVaw3F4b4jxESE6ggVClKCh7Ch), published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, stated, though no further study on soil and water in the Depot neighborhoods has been done since.[\[y\]](#cmnt25)

## V.

After grade school[\[z\]](#cmnt26), Frank lost touch, a bit, with the Bradshaws. Having developed a penchant for musical theater in high school, Frank decided to major in vocal performance and choral conducting at the University of Memphis. But in the mid-nineties, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Her behavior shifted, and she had sudden outbursts of aggressive behavior. She needed to be tended to 24/7. “I wasn’t able to really keep up with that schedule,” he said. It got so bad, that after a visit to the psych ward, the family found out the cancer had spread to her brain. Frank dropped the vocal performance major, which was rigorous and required extensive rehearsal and additional classwork. In 1999, after a two year struggle, his mom passed away.

Years later, and with no warning, in 2014, his sister Karen, collapsed on the floor after work. It was a total surprise. She’d had some health issues as a kid, and knew she was lead-exposed, so she’d become a nurse to help others manage similar conditions. She’d made a point of exercising every day, and eating healthy. “She knows the family history. So she was going to do her best to avert being diagnosed with cancer,” Frank explained.

It turned out Karen had a brain tumor in the same spot as the mass doctors had found in their mother. Two days later, Frank’s aunt Elaine got the same diagnosis. Yet again, the family was devastated.

Reeling from the bad news, Frank ran into his old friend, Ms. Doris’ son Victor, who invited him over to the brick home on the hilltop. It had been a while. Ms. Doris was there, and she asked about his family. So he started telling her about Karen. “You know that’s a common cancer over here,” Ms. Doris told him. Frank looked at her, dismayed, as she explained the work she’d been doing over the past two decades, why she’d been busy on the phone talking about hazardous waste when he used to come over. As it turned out, two generations of residents had been calling it “Depot cancer.” “Diagnosed on Sunday, dead by the next Sunday,” so the saying went.

Much like the realizations Ms. Doris had in the mid-nineties, Frank started reading and researching. The more he did, the more that friends and neighbors popped into his head, like his neighbor Jasmine, who had to get a hysterectomy because she was developing so many fibroids. A [2002 study](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://europepmc.org/article/med/12938400'&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714985565&usg=AOvVaw29G61qRpLpB6Q2RB2kvoIO) found that women with chronic fibroids tended to have higher levels of copper and chromium, than those without the condition. He thought of the Taylor daughters who lived two houses down, who both developed bone cancer. And he got back out in the neighborhood and started talking to people. “It’s like, it’s the same story,” he said. “We’d been glowing in the dark over here for years.”

By the time Frank got involved, Ms. Doris was struggling with her own kidney issues. She’d had to slow down some from all of her traveling, and from fighting to stop policies like one that would have given U.S. military facilities exemptions from Superfund cleanup liability. But she still managed to stay on top of the latest.  
  
In July 2021, residents heard word that the Depot Redevelopment Corporation Board — the group that Shelby County and the City of Memphis created and authorized to manage the sale of the Depot facility to private investors — was about to be dissolved by another group, the Economic Development Growth Engine, known as the EDGE board, itself funded into existence by $15 million from the sale of the Depot facilities, in 2012.  

Using proceeds from the sale of the Depot, over the past decade since the sale, the EDGE Board had issued grants to all kinds of area organizations: $2.5 million for a road improvement project at the Frank C. Pidgeon Industrial Park; $1 million in loan forgiveness for a dock demolition project on President’s Island. Perhaps most shockingly, the EDGE Board has sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Chambers of Commerce in Arlington, Bartlett, Collierville, Germantown, Lakeland and Millionton — wealthy, white suburban towns — for “local economic development initiatives.” Meanwhile, not a single dollar has landed in the hands of local residents, in service of their visions[\[aa\]](#cmnt27), Frank told me. “They thought we’re going to forget about it.” But they haven’t.

“The EDGE board stole our money that was supposed to come here,” Ms. Doris said. “They did not follow the program. We would have had solar panels over there. They sent it everywhere but to this community.”

Depot-area residents are not alone in their complaints that government clean-up and redevelopment efforts have squarely left them out. \[Still pending: quote from Terry Roland, Trump-supporting Republican who agrees that Depot residents “got robbed.”\] And then there’s Joe Kent[\[ab\]](#cmnt28), a workforce and curriculum development specialist, and self-described white suburban dweller and “investigative blogger,” who has worked religiously to track what he refers to as “systematic disinvestment” from the Depot area neighborhoods by the EDGE Board.

When I sat down for lunch with him, Joe, who is over six feet tall, with broad shoulders and a booming voice, referred to the depletion of Depot Redevelopment Corporation funds as the biggest taxpayer atrocity he had ever seen. On the other side of a silver, glittery diner booth, Joe pulled out two stacks of documents — reports from the Comptroller’s office outlining each transaction, and diagrams displaying the names and photos of exactly which city electeds voted in favor of issuing each of the grants.

He also pulled out a stack of monopoly money, and proceeded to hand me stacks of paper cash representing each grant issued with proceeds from the sale of the Depot facilities, until it was just about all gone. “One million for dock demolition … Go ahead and put that in your pocket,” he said, after counting out each simulated grant amount shuttled away from direct reinvestment in Frank and Ms. Doris’ area. “I can’t see how creating a donut hole in the middle of Memphis is good for anyone,” he concluded.

I have since verified all the documents he brought me, and his case checks out, though it is not necessarily an altruistic one. While Joe does believe the city owes Depot-area residents the $10 million they’ve demonstrably siphoned elsewhere, he also denies that race has anything to do with this particular injustice. And, he thinks that he would be a prime candidate to receive, and then distribute those funds to Depot residents.[\[ac\]](#cmnt29)

## VII.

Where workers once ran down wooden planks to pack up uniforms and fuel bound for U.S. military operations on every corner of the globe, or dug hundreds of feet into the loamy soil to bury the waste of war; where Ms. Doris once peered through the barbed wire fence crowning Dunn Field wondering what was underground; and where Frank once walked to Norris Elementary, crossing over a drainage ditch and dodging dead birds on his way; now, an industrial park sits, a blue and white sign soliciting vacancies mounted prominently on the road leading south to the airport.

Since the early 2000’s, according to the [EPA’s reports](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://semspub.epa.gov/work/04/11111587.pdf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714988071&usg=AOvVaw0LubYHwHqLpOeJ6P1vrpD_), the Depot grounds have gotten cleaner: soils once contaminated with metals, petroleum hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds have been excavated, hauled off site and treated with a process called soil vapor extraction. The groundwater once contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds has gone through rounds of enhanced bioremediation and air sparging.

But while these remedies are “protective of human health,” as public notices declare, it’s still a Superfund site. As of May 2022, [448 Superfund sites](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epa.gov/superfund/deleted-national-priorities-list-npl-sites-deletion-date&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714988592&usg=AOvVaw0ZJshdKpoI3dN2wFazJsni) across the U.S. have been officially deleted from the National Priorities List, because following intensive cleanup, [according to the EPA](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-national-priorities-list-deletion%23:~:text%3DEPA%2520may%2520delete%2520a%2520final,human%2520health%2520or%2520the%2520environment.&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714988920&usg=AOvVaw0ufD0Z_YAvS94XGfqw2BbQ), “no further response is required.” The Memphis Defense Depot, however, 27 years after its listing, remains on the list.  

Forty-six acres of the former Depot are now home to a golf course open to anyone wanting to play ten holes over lunch. Barnhart Crane & Rigging purchased 143 acres to store lifting equipment for heavy industry. The Memphis Police Department inherited what is now a police station.[\[ad\]](#cmnt30)

But there are no solar panels to be found on Dunn Field, no community health centers in close distance to residents in need of dialysis or cancer treatment, two things Ms. Doris says area residents — the survivors of the Defense Depot — are still owed.  

Outside of Hamilton High, the trickle of Cane Creek behind us, Frank tells me it’s beyond overdue for officials to make things right for residents like his sister Karen, who now has trouble walking, and whose speech is slowed, following her brain surgery. “Renovate these people’s houses, set up the damn solar farm. Nobody over here should be in debt for a house. Go in and look after these families.”

But there’s another thing that funding alone won’t bring: “Admit what the hell you did wrong,” Frank says, with a surefire tone. “You have a lot of burden here, people just beating themselves up thinking that we did something wrong. Black folks thinking that we brought this upon ourselves, that we’re not eating right, when it’s not that,” he told me, indignant. “It’s living next to these sites.”

Two generations of Depot residents have died in the midst of a fight for transparency and a cleaner, safer neighborhood, without seeing many improvements in their lives. Now, through its [Justice40 Initiative](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714990204&usg=AOvVaw3jrARCOb5TFtn7y0H6Xunk), the Biden administration has [earmarked billions of dollars](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/05/23/delivering-historic-and-long-overdue-investments-in-disadvantaged-communities/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1661202714990610&usg=AOvVaw0tQGwUKc6Qdv_ixhDh6lPu) for investments that benefit what they’ve defined as “disadvantaged communities,” like where Ms. Doris and Frank live. It remains to be seen how much of that money will land in the hands of environmental justice experts and organizers, to execute long-standing visions, like Ms. Doris’ swath of solar panels cascading over Dunn Field, lighting up all the houses around it, and easing the burden of hi.

  
When I visit Ms. Doris again later that day, a warm breeze brushing over her hill, she opens an envelope addressed to her from Methodist Hospital. Ms. Doris is waiting for good news any day now: a letter or a call confirming that her doctor has found her a kidney donor. At 67, she’s the oldest person on her block, and she intends to keep it that way. With her kidney disease under control, after the transplant, she’ll be able to keep fighting for her family and neighbors, as she’s been doing her whole life.

“I’m going to be okay,” she assures me. “I told my grandson, ‘I ain’t going nowhere til you graduate.’”
